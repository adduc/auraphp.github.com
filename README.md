# The complete reference for Aura #

The book complete reference in Aura, is a WIP to help people learn 
aura framework, apart from using its components individually.

Most of the contents are same as that of the individual packages, with
some changes to combine all the packages.

The book is made possible with [easybook](https://packagist.org/packages/easybook/easybook)
