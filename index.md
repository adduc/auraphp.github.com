Introduction
============

The Aura project provides independent library packages for PHP 5.4+. These
packages can be used alone, in concert with each other, or combined into a
full-stack framework of their own.

The Aura project is essentially the second major version of
[Solar](http://solarphp.com), reimagined and rewritten as a library collection
with dependency injection instead of a framework with service location. (The
name change from Solar to Aura is to reduce confusion with the Apache Solr
project.)

The project has released the first stable packages. Read more from
[First Stable 1.0.0 Library Releases](http://auraphp.github.com/2012/11/12/first-stable-releases/).
Please fork the various library package repositories or the system
skeleton repository, and help us keep high-quality libraries available and
maintained for PHP 5.4+.

Available Packages
==================

The Aura project centers around a collection of independent packages. Each
package is self-contained and has only the things it needs for its core
purpose. None of the packages depends on any of the other; you can use each of
the packages on its own:

- **[Autoload](https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Autoload):** A PSR-0 compliant
  autoloader, ready for SplClassloader.
  *([api versions](http://auraphp.github.com/Aura.Autoload))*

- **[Cli](https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Cli):** Tools to build command-line
  controllers, including a CLI context, options management, and input/ouput
  handlers.
  *([api versions](http://auraphp.github.com/Aura.Cli))*

- **[Di](https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Di):** Dependency injection
  container.
  *([api versions](http://auraphp.github.com/Aura.Di))*

- **[Filter](https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Filter):** Provides validation and
  sanitizing for data objects.
  *([api versions](http://auraphp.github.com/Aura.Filter))*

- **[Framework](https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Framework):** The only package
  that has dependencies, this package wraps the others to provide a
  component-based framework library.
  *([api versions](http://auraphp.github.com/Aura.Framework))*

- **[Http](https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Http):** Tools to build HTTP
  request and response messages.
  *([api versions](http://auraphp.github.com/Aura.Http))*

- **[Intl](https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Intl):** Provides internationalization 
  (I18N) tools, specifically package-oriented per-locale message translation.
  *([api versions](http://auraphp.github.com/Aura.Intl))*
  
- **[Marshal](https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Marshal):** Marshals data from
  any data source into domain objects, including relationships between those
  object.
  *([api versions](http://auraphp.github.com/Aura.Marshal))*

- **[Router](https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Router):** A web router.
  *([api versions](http://auraphp.github.com/Aura.Router))*

- **[Session](https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Session):** Session management 
  functionality, including session segments, read-once ("flash") values, CSRF 
  tools, and lazy session starting.
  *([api versions](http://auraphp.github.com/Aura.Session))*

- **[Signal](https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Signal):** A signal slots / event
  handler implementation.
  *([api versions](http://auraphp.github.com/Aura.Signal))*

- **[Sql](https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Sql):** SQL database connection and
  query tools.
  *([api versions](http://auraphp.github.com/Aura.Sql))*

- **[Uri](https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Uri):** Provides objects to 
  help you create and manipulate URLs, including query strings and path elements.
  *([api versions](http://auraphp.github.com/Aura.Uri))*

- **[View](https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.View):** Template views, two-step
  views, and view helpers.
  *([api versions](http://auraphp.github.com/Aura.View))*

- **[Web](https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Web):** A bare-bones web page
  controller system, including pre- and post-hooks, a response transfer
  object, and context discovery.
  *([api versions](http://auraphp.github.com/Aura.Web))*

The Aura project also includes a [system](https://github.com/auraphp/system)
that composes the independent packages into a full-stack framework.


Goals and Standards
===================

Libraries First, Framework Second
---------------------------------

The primary goal of Aura is to provide high-quality, well-tested,
[standards-compliant](http://php-fig.org), independent library packages that
can be used in any codebase. This means developers can use as much or as
little of the project as necessary.

In line with the goal of "libraries first", all packages are as self-contained
as possible and are independently downloadable. In some cases this level of
independence may lead to some class duplication between packages. In other
cases, it may lead to data-transfer objects being used to carry information
across package boundaries, so that the package can be used with non-Aura
codebases.

Aura has enough libraries to form a full-stack framework of its own. A system
repository is available to incorporate them all into a coherent framework for
application development. Note that the libraries were developed first, and
were not originally coupled to each other in a framework.


High-Quality, Well-Tested
-------------------------

With very few exception, all classes in all packages have 100% test coverage.


Standards-Compliant
-------------------

The packages available through the Aura project all conform to the currently
accepted standards of the [PHP Framework Interoperability
Group](http://www.php-fig.org/).

- [PSR-0](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-0.md),
- [PSR-1](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-1-basic-coding-standard.md), 
- [PSR-2](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md).

Other Aura-specific standards include:

- No use of public properties, unless they are magic via `__get()/__set()`

- No use of underscore with protected elements

- Use of the pre-existing Solar vocabulary for
  [methods](http://solarphp.com/manual/appendix-standards.naming.methods)


PHP 5.4+
--------

Aura is intended to take advantage of the features available in PHP 5.4+ (as
compared to PHP 5.2.x and prior). This means formal namespaces, anonymous
functions and closures, late static binding, short array syntax, traits, the
callable typehint, and other features not available in PHP 5.2.x and earlier.


Techniques
----------

- Use dependency injection proper instead of the service-locator
  `Solar::dependency()` system; the basis for this exists at
  [https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Di](https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Di)

- Find effective and reasonable uses for closures/anonymous functions,
  primarily for object creation within the dependency injector service
  definitions

- Use explicit configuration more often than implicit convention

- Compose functionality as much as possible through dependency injection,
  instead of through inheritance and base classes

- Use factories as object creators in general, rather than as adapter creators
  in specific

- Windows Vista/7 support as-we-go, so that Windows users are part of the
  community from the very beginning
