            If you like <strong>clean</strong> code, <strong>fully
            decoupled</strong> libraries, and truly
            <strong>independent packages</strong>, then the Aura
            project is for you. Download a single package and start
            using it in your project today, with <strong>no added
            dependencies</strong>.

        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            The primary goal of Aura is to provide high-quality, well-tested,
            <a href="http://php-fig.org">standards-compliant</a>, decoupled
            libraries that can be used in any codebase. This means you can use
            as much or as little of the project as you like.

        <h2>Packages</h2>
        <p>
            The Aura project centers around a collection of independent
            packages. Each package is self-contained and has only the things
            it needs for its core purpose. None of the packages depends on any
            of the other; you can download and use each of the packages on its
            own.

        <h2>Framework</h2>
        <p>
            Aura has enough libraries to form a full-stack framework of its
            own. A system repository is available to incorporate them all into
            a coherent framework for application development.
